[Remote Control Detector](https://github.com/shabaz123/MiniExperimenterProjects/tree/main/RemoteControlDetector): A simple project that can detect when a button is pressed on an infra-red remote control! Most TV remotes will work (you can check by pointing the remote at your mobile phone camera, pressing any button, and seeing if you can see a faint glow when viewing the video from the camera).
