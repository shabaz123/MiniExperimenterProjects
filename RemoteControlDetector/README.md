# Remote Control Detector

This project can be used to detect infra-red remote controls!

## What Does it Do?

Press a button on any remote control (well, infra-red based remote controls) such as a TV remote, and the light-emitting diode (LED) will flash!

## How Does it Work?

All TVs contain a little integrated circuit (IC) that senses light with an internal photodiode, and then amplifies the signal provided it is changing rapidly (at about 38 kHz). An output signal indicates the presence of the rapidly changing light. The circuit uses such an integrated circuit, part code TL1838. 

Beyond that, all that is needed in the circuit is a way to reduce or regulate the power to the chip (it needs to be less than 5V not to damage it). An LED is connected to the output of the chip, through a resistor to limit the current (LEDs donâ€™t need a lot of power).
